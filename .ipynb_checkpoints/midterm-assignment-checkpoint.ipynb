    "Kickstarter, started in 2009, is one of the leading crowdfunding platform aiming to bring creative projects to life.[1] Compared with other platforms, Kickstarter is a product-oriented platform, pre-selling proposed products to \"backers\", who would pledge and pay before the products are launched. However, new fundraisers usually only know the qualitative characteristics successful campaigns should have, such as \"having engaging multimedia promotion materials\", \"be futuristic\" etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantitative characteristics that a successful campaign has, however, are not commonly known. For example, timeframe for delivery, country to launch/promote, product pricing and pledging options. These quantitative characteristics, though they can make or break a project, can only be vaguely guessed based on intuition, as statistics are not readily available.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This research aims at producing these insights by identifying the key metrics of successful kickstarter campaigns, including demographics of backers, geolocations of the teams, product categories, timing of launch and available pledging options. As such, these insights could inform a potential fundraiser on campaign planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "This research would focus on the kickstarter platform but not other crowdfunding platforms such as goFundMe, indiegogo."

    "Web scraping was used as a primary tool to collect data directly from Kickstarter. The first 200 pages of https://www.kickstarter.com/discover/advanced?sort=most_funded&page=1 are publicly available which contains 12 projects each, sorted by the amount funded. At each product page, the name, total count of backers, total amount, the currency, the target amount, the city of of the fundraiser, the product's category, the length of the funding period in days and the pledging options offered are noted. Then, the community page would be scraped for the top 10 backing countries and the count of new / returning backers of the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Primary data directly from Kickstarter is the most reliable source for this research, since it is where the data originated. According to the robots.txt [2] on the website, certain pages are not allowed to be scraped. The web scraper developed in this research would not be accessing forbidden pages. A 2 second sleep between each page is included to keep the webscraping unobstrutive to the normal traffic. Since the data are publicly available and are popular crowdfunded projects, there should not be any personal information required to be anonymised. It is possible that the insights derived from this data is biased towards the Kickstarter platform, since the research is only analysing there, and the demographic of the campaigns/backer would be majorly English-speaking as crowdfunders in other countries/languages may prefer other platforms. Kickstarter itself is an American website, which has a strong US user base and may distort the result towards the US.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are other data sources for this purpose of research, available on Kaggle by Michael Mouille. [3] It is a wealthy dataset with over 300k projects collected in 2016 and 2018. However, this dataset is not deep enough to analyze for the questions posed in this research. For example, it lacks the demographics of backers and pledging options. There is another dataset by Web Robots [4]which crawled kickstarter and available in JSON, CSV format. While this data is also rich, the data directly scraped are more focused on successful campaigns which can answer our questions poised more easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data collected via scraping placed no factors on when the campaign was. Thus, the analysis that based on it may not be timely as past successful campaigns may not perform as well if launched in the present."

    "Since Kickstarter is an American site, over 62% of the the backers come from the US, followed by the British backer. There are categories which backers from a certain country prefers, such as Animation in France. The fundraising team usually raise more funds in their home country, compared with global average. Thus, if a fundraiser wants to succeed in his campaign, he should be aware of the country preference and consider to start there, attracting more local audiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "The funding period usually last 1 month but the delivery period can be longer. Tangible products usually deliver quicker than intangible products. Backers presume more risk on longer projects, as it is possible a tangible product goes beyond budget and eventually defaulted. Intangible product on the other hand enjoy longer delivery projects, as long as constant updates are given. Thus, for tangible products, kickstarter are more suitable as a promotional venue and production already lined up. For intangible products, backers can be beta users of the product and provide early funding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prices of the products remain in line with existing store-bought products, as backers do not seem to pay premiums for newer products. High-end products maybe hard to succeed on the kickstarter platform, and retail products that provide a niche edge over store-bought products may find huge success in terms of volume on the kickstarter platform."

    "A majority of the projects have around 30 days for their funding period. In the top six categories that have more than 100 projects, Tabletop games (mean = 25.5, std = 7.38) has less funding period than others. Backers for gadgets (mean = 41.3, std = 10.1) and hardwares (mean = 39.6, std = 10.4) usually have a longer funding period. \n",

    "However, funding period length does not correlate with delivery lead time. The most common delivery times for tabletop games is 1-2 year, with the most common pledging option at 335 days. For product design, it is 4-5 months and over 1 year for video games. Hardware and gadgets, on the other hand, have shorter lead time with usually 2-3  months and 4-5 lead months instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "This represented the greater risks that backer perceives tangible deliverables and thus backing more with short delivery lead times. Intangible deliverables such as videogames, animations have over an year on delivery. Thus, fundraisers for tangible projects treat kickstarter more as a promotional channel where they can launch the products and promise a quick delivery, and intangible projects enjoys kickstarter community as early birds for their project's development."
